# Problem Description

The modern political landscape is characterized by high complexity, competing interests, and a lack of transparent mechanisms that allow citizens and analysts to simulate the legislative process.

Moreover, the legislative process in parliamentary democracies relies on negotiations and decisions made both at the level of political parties and individual MPs, making it difficult to predict voting outcomes.

There is a lack of tools that:

- Simulate political decision-making processes in a way that is understandable to the average citizen.
- Allow users to experiment with political scenarios (e.g., "Would law X pass if politicians Y voted?").
- Use artificial intelligence to simulate the behavior of political agents (parties, politicians).
- Combine data from open knowledge sources (e.g., Wikipedia) and analyze them in the context of legislation.
